My mind races. I want something. I'm not sure what it is, but there is something
that I want. I think that what I want is a her. It is scary though. I haven't
been in this kind of situation for a very long time. I haven't liked a girl and
not known how she has felt about me for years at this point. Though I guess that
technically isn't true either. I just didn't know that it was actually happening
to me in my last relationship.

I will see her on Thursday. I want to keep going to these quizes with Johanne
and Isabelle. I think that my reasoning is that if I become a part of her life
and spend enough time with her, eventually we'll get in a situation where either
I kiss her or she kisses me. We'll then have to figure out how we feel about
each other.
